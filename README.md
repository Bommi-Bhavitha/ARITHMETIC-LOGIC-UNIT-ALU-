Design and Simulation of a Basic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) Using Verilog in Xilinx Vivado

Description:

This project involves the design and simulation of a basic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog HDL in the Xilinx Vivado environment. The ALU is a critical component of a digital processor responsible for executing arithmetic and logic operations. The ALU designed here performs five key operations: Addition, Subtraction, Bitwise AND, Bitwise OR, and Bitwise NOT.

            
The development process includes writing the Verilog module for the ALU, creating a testbench to apply different input combinations, and performing simulation using Vivado's built-in simulation tools. The simulation results are analyzed using waveforms to verify the correctness of each operation.

Applications:

Foundation for designing processors, microcontrollers, and custom datapaths.
Used in Embedded Systems, Digital Signal Processing, and Computer Architecture.
Educational projects for learning Digital Design, HDL, and Simulation Workflows.
